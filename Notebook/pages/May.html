        <p>Strains BP233, BP235 and 168 (WT) were incubated in 4 ml LB medium for 4 h at 37°C and 220 rpm. 2 ml of the culture was harvested, and the cells were washed in 1xC-salts and then resuspended in 300 µl 1xC-salts. BP233 and BP235 were plated on CS-glucose with and without 10 mM glyphosate.</p>

        <p>As seen in this figure, both strains grow well on CS-glucose without glyphosate. Strain BP233 also forms a lawn on plates with 10mM glyphosate, while the wildtype does not form a lawn, but single colonies, which could be suppressor mutants. This leads to the hypothesis that GltT, which is a glutamate transporter, transports glyphosate into the cell. The strain BP235 was not stable, so it was constructed again!

            <li>Mix the ingredients of the running gel and pour the solution quickly (gel starts to polymerize once TEMED has been added) into the gap between the glass plates. Leave enough room for the stacking gel – appr. 1 cm below the bottom of the comb´s teeth. After a minute you can overlay the solution with iso-propanol or ethanol. This excludes the access of oxygen and plane the surface
            </li>
            <li>After polymerization, pour off the iso-propanol and rinse with distilled water. Mix the reagents for the stacking gel and pour it on top of the running gel till the space is completely full. Then insert the comb. No alcohol overlay is needed due to the comb.</li>
            <li>After polymerization clamp the gel into the electrophoresis apparatus and fill it with running buffer. Remove the comb carefully and use a pipette or syringe to wash the wells with running buffer.</li>
            <li>The protein samples (up to 15&nbsp;&micro;l) are mixed with SDS loading buffer (2.5&nbsp;&micro;l) and incubated for 10 min at 95&deg;C.</li>
            <li>After heating briefly centrifuge the samples to spin down the condensed water.</li>
            <li>Then you can apply the samples on a SDS PAGE with a pipette or Hamilton microliter syringe. Do not forget to add molecular weight marker in one lane.</li>
            <li>Run the gel at 80&nbsp;V until the front has moved into the running gel. Then you can increase the voltage to 120&nbsp;V. Run the gel until the running front has reached the bottom of the running gel.</li>
            <li>Pry the plates apart by using a gel spacer. The gel can then be stained (Coomassie staining, method 56 or Silver staining, method 57) to visualize the separated proteins or processed further (Western Blotting, method 58).</li>
